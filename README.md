# Socialcademy
The project where I experimented with SwiftUI and Firebase while completing the course Codecademy iOS Developer Career Path (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer). The application is a prototype of a social network with registration, feed, and adding posts, and comments.

The project was created in 2022, and the refactoring was in 2023.

I will be very grateful if you tell me about errors in the project or suggest improvements.
